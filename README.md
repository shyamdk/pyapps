It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this


Headers
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
Emphasis
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
